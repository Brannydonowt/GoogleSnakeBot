Rules of snake
The snake can move up, down, left or right
The snake moves at a constant speed in a given direction
The snake must collect apples that spawn 1 after the other
For every apple the snake collects, it's length grows by 1
The snake cannot collide with itself, or else it dies
The snake cannot collide with a wall, or else it dies

With these rules in mind, I can begin to think about how my bot will need to behave - and what elements I need to make my bot aware of.
