# multithreaded frame labelling
# some caveats/problems that might arise
# 1 - accessing information from other classes might become troublesome
#       - Perhaps having a game parser that gets all relevant info and is then passed into this, would work.
#       -   The main thread would then have to look something like this:
#           - StreamVideo
#           - ParseVideo
#           - Do calculations
#           - Do actions <- Actions should be done before results are rendered to the screen? As labelling the screen might take a lot of time
#           - Label frame
#           - Show fram
