# GoogleSnakeBot

## A Google Snake Bot Written with Python

This bot is being written as an introduction to Python

### Getting Started
To run the bot: 
1) Ensure you have python installed
2) Clone the repository to your desired location

3) In the environment, run the following commands
```
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Assuming there are no errors, you should now be able to run bot/bot.py 

---

Read pseudo.txt to understand my plans/thoughts behind developing the bot.

You will likely find some strange/non-standard conventions. I come from a C# background so I am applying a similar coding style here. 

You will likely find duplicated code between the different 'bot', 'tests' folders.

I plan to develop/experiment with ideas in the 'tests' folder, before finalising a concept and implementing it into the 'bot' folder.
