# GoogleSnakeBot

A Google Snake Bot Written with Python and Open CV

This bot is being written as an introduction to Python

Read pseudo.txt to understand my plans/thoughts behind developing the bot.

You will likely find some strange/non-standard conventions. I come from a C# background so I am applying a similar coding style here. 

You will likely find duplicated code between the different 'bot', 'tests' folders.

I plan to develop/experiment with ideas in the 'tests' folder, before finalising a concept and implementing it into the 'bot' folder.
