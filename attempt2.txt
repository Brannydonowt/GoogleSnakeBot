So it has been a few  months since I last attempted this project.

The goal, of course, is to make Google Snake play itself - using only Python.

This is of course, as an introduction to the Python language, and the world of botting/image recognition.

In my last approach, my plan was to simulate the Snake Game in Python, and replicate the moves on the Google Snake board.

I ran into issues with making the Python game synchronise with the Google Snake game and eventually gave up.

I've archived that attempt, as botAttempt1 - which ended up being a bot that just moves the snake around in circles.

Moving on to botAttempt2 - I'm going to start from scratch, using what I've already learned from my past attempt.

My idea this time is to stray away from the concept of the game being on a brid - and instead focus on moving the snake to pixel coordinates.

I'll start out by making the snake avoid the game boundary.
